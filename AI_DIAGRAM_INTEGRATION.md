# AI-Powered 3D Medical Diagram Integration

## Overview

The Novate medical notes system now features **AI-Generated 3D Interactive Body Diagrams** that dynamically adapt based on:

- **Patient Gender** (Male/Female/Others)
- **Examination Type** (General, Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Abdominal, Neurological, Musculoskeletal)
- **Body Regions Being Examined**
- **Examination Findings** (Normal/Abnormal indicators)

## Key Features

### ü§ñ **AI-Powered Generation**
- **Dynamic Diagram Creation**: AI generates diagrams based on patient demographics and examination requirements
- **Gender-Specific Anatomy**: Automatically adjusts anatomical representation based on patient gender
- **Smart Region Detection**: AI identifies relevant body regions for specific examination types
- **Intelligent Highlighting**: Abnormal findings are visually emphasized

### üéÆ **3D Interactive Interface**
- **Real-time 3D Rendering**: Built with React Three Fiber for smooth 3D interactions
- **Interactive Body Regions**: Click on 3D body parts to add examination findings
- **Dynamic Visual Feedback**: 
  - üî¥ Red dots = Not examined
  - üü¢ Green dots = Examined with findings
  - üîµ Blue dots = Currently selected
- **Intuitive Controls**: Rotate, zoom, and pan around the 3D model

### üìã **Clinical Integration**
- **Multiple Examination Types**: Specialized diagrams for different medical examinations
- **Real-time Updates**: Findings sync instantly across all diagram views  
- **PDF Integration**: All findings appear in generated medical reports
- **Professional Accuracy**: Medically accurate anatomical representations

## Technical Architecture

### AI Service Layer (`lib/ai-diagram-service.ts`)
```typescript
interface DiagramGenerationConfig {
  patientGender: 'Male' | 'Female' | 'Others'
  examinationType: 'general' | 'cardiovascular' | 'respiratory' | 'abdominal'
  bodyRegions: string[]
  examinationFindings: { [region: string]: string }
  highlightAbnormal: boolean
  view3D: boolean
}
```

### 3D Rendering Component (`components/examination/ai-3d-body-diagram.tsx`)
- **React Three Fiber**: 3D rendering engine
- **Interactive Regions**: Clickable 3D body parts with hover effects
- **Dynamic Materials**: Visual indicators based on examination status
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### Integration Points
1. **Medical Note Editor**: Primary examination interface
2. **PDF Generator**: Findings exported to medical reports
3. **Data Storage**: Examination findings persisted with medical notes

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```typescript
<AI3DBodyDiagram
  gender="Female"
  findings={examinationFindings}
  onFindingChange={handleFindingChange}
  examinationType="cardiovascular"
  disabled={false}
/>
```

### Multiple Specialized Diagrams
The system automatically generates:
- **General Body Examination**: Full-body overview
- **Cardiovascular Focus**: Heart and circulatory system
- **Respiratory Focus**: Lungs and breathing system  
- **Abdominal Focus**: Digestive organs and abdomen

## AI Generation Process

1. **Configuration Analysis**: AI analyzes patient gender, examination type, and current findings
2. **Prompt Construction**: Intelligent medical prompts generated for accurate diagrams
3. **3D Model Generation**: AI creates anatomically correct 3D representations
4. **Interactive Region Mapping**: AI identifies clickable examination points
5. **Real-time Updates**: Diagrams adapt as examination findings are added

## Environment Configuration

Add these variables to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# AI Diagram Generation
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_DIAGRAM_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_DIAGRAM_BASE_URL=https://api.novate-ai-diagrams.com

# Optional AI Enhancements
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
STABILITY_API_KEY=your_stability_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_3D_DIAGRAMS=true
```

## Fallback System

If AI generation fails, the system automatically:
1. **Falls back to predefined diagrams**
2. **Maintains full interactivity**
3. **Logs errors for monitoring**
4. **Provides visual feedback to users**

## Clinical Benefits

### üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è **For Medical Professionals**
- **Visual Examination Guide**: Interactive 3D reference during patient examinations
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: All findings captured with precise anatomical locations
- **Gender-Appropriate Diagrams**: Clinically accurate representations for all patients
- **Specialized Views**: Focused diagrams for specific examination types

### üìä **For Medical Records**
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Visual representation of examination findings
- **Standardized Format**: Consistent examination recording across all patients
- **PDF Integration**: Professional medical reports with 3D diagram summaries
- **Audit Trail**: Complete examination history with visual context

### üéØ **For Patient Care**
- **Improved Accuracy**: AI-assisted examination ensures comprehensive coverage
- **Visual Communication**: 3D diagrams help explain findings to patients
- **Personalized Care**: Gender-specific and condition-specific examination protocols

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time AI Suggestions**: AI recommends examination areas based on symptoms
- **Voice Integration**: Voice commands for hands-free examination documentation
- **AR/VR Support**: Augmented reality overlays for physical examinations
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for global medical practice

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: All 3D rendering libraries are included
2. **Configure Environment**: Set up AI service API keys
3. **Enable Feature**: Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_3D_DIAGRAMS=true`
